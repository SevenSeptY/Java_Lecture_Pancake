A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. The method is accessible to every instance of a class,
but methods defined in an instance are only able to be accessed by that object of a class.

Whan we have common attribute or method, we can define as Static

public static void main(String[] args){
//Block
}
Main method : Maximum access  
Public : no need to creat object 
Static:
Void : no return value
Main :
String[] args:
